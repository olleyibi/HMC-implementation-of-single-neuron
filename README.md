# HMC-implementation-of-single-neuron
Implement Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Bayesian treatment of the single neuron.

The target distribution will be the likelihood function for the single neuron model

Experiment with different values for the burn in and lag parameters, noticing that 
the lag parameter can have much smaller values than for Metropolis.

Then give a contour plot of the predictive distribution (average neuron output), as
well as a plot of the sample autocorrelation.
